## Group T03G10

## TP 1 Notes

- In the first exercise (1), we created *_myTriangle.js_*, using the already given code on *_myDiamond.js_* as a base. We edited the vertices coordinates and the indices. The parallelogram was created in *_myParallelogram.js_* following the same approach. However, we also reversed the order of the indices to ensure that the back of the parallelogram was also displayed.
- In the second exercise (2), we created *_myTriangleSmall.js_* and *_myTriangleBig.js_* which are very similar to each other. We used *_myTriangle.js_* as a base and modified both vertices and indices.
- Additionally, checkboxes were added for all figures, allowing us to control which ones should be displayed.
